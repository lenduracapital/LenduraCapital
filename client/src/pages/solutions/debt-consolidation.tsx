          question: "What types of debt can be consolidated?",

        },
        {
          question: "Will debt consolidation hurt my credit score?",
          answer: "Initially there may be a small impact from credit inquiries, but consolidation often improves credit scores over time by reducing utilization ratios and simplifying payment management."
        },
        {
          question: "How much can I save with debt consolidation?",
          answer: "Savings vary based on your current debt structure, but many businesses reduce monthly payments by 20-40% and save significantly on interest over the loan term."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does the consolidation process take?",
          answer: "The debt consolidation process typically takes 2-4 weeks from application to funding, including time for underwriting and paying off existing creditors."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I consolidate if I have bad credit?",
          answer: "Yes, debt consolidation options are available for businesses with poor credit. While rates may be higher, consolidation can still provide payment relief and help rebuild credit."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens to my existing accounts after consolidation?",
          answer: "Existing debt accounts are paid off and closed as part of the consolidation process. You'll then have one new loan with a single monthly payment instead of multiple payments."
