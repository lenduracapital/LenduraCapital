Redesign and refactor my existing project for SEO optimization without removing or changing my current 12 Solution and 18 Industry pages.

1. Page Structure

Keep all current slugs/URLs exactly the same.

Update each Solution and Industry page layout to include:

H1: Main keyword (page topic).

H2: What is [Keyword]?

H2: Why Businesses Use [Keyword]

H2: Which Businesses Use [Keyword]? → auto-render internal links.

H2: How Lendura Capital Helps

H2: Key Benefits of [Keyword] (bullet list).

H2: FAQs (expandable accordion + JSON-LD schema).

CTA block at bottom (“Apply Now” form).

2. SEO Enhancements

Install and configure next-seo for dynamic meta titles, descriptions, and OpenGraph per page.

Generate/update sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

Add JSON-LD structured data:

FAQ schema per page.

Organization schema sitewide.

Ensure all images use <Image> with descriptive alt text.

3. Performance & UX

Target Lighthouse score 90+:

Compress images.

Lazy-load non-critical components.

Purge unused CSS/JS.

Mobile-first readability: short paragraphs, bullet points, large touch targets.

Sticky navbar with smooth scroll to CTAs.

4. Components Refactor

Create reusable components in /components:

Hero.jsx

CTAButton.jsx

FAQAccordion.jsx

BenefitList.jsx

Layout.jsx
Replace repetitive inline code across all 30 pages with these components.

6. Internal Linking (Critical)

Create /lib/internalLinks.js mapping file.

Each Solution links to 3–5 relevant Industries.

Each Industry links back to 3–5 relevant Solutions.

Under “Which Businesses Use [Keyword]?”, auto-render these links dynamically.

Use keyword-rich anchor text (e.g., “Trucking & Logistics Financing” instead of “Trucking”).

System must be modular so updating one mapping file updates all links sitewide.

7. Deliverable

Do not delete or rename existing pages.

Insert SEO-optimized structure + comments like:

<!-- Replace with optimized copy for [Solution/Industry] -->
