## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- Modern, adaptive styling using Tailwind CSS.
- Optimized for responsiveness across devices with GPU-accelerated rendering.
- Intelligent resource loading, including adaptive video quality streaming and smart preloading systems.
- Critical resource prioritization for faster initial paint.
- Clean user interface without distracting performance displays (e.g., removed visual "load ..ms" indicator).
- **Mobile Navigation**: Completely redesigned mobile menu with professional card-based layout, collapsible sections (Our Services, Our Company, Resource Hub), and prominent CTA buttons. Clean typography without icons for Guides/Blog entries. Features proper z-index stacking, pointer-events handling, and smooth animations.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for data fetching, and Shadcn/ui components.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL integration, comprehensive security middleware, and production-ready error handling and logging.
- **Environment Management**: Enterprise-grade environment variable management with Zod-based validation, auto-detection of deployment platforms (Replit, Railway, Vercel, Heroku), and platform-specific configuration optimization.
- **Deployment Process**: Utilizes `esbuild` for server bundling and Vite for frontend builds. Comprehensive build verification ensures `dist/index.js` (or `dist/start.js` as needed) and static assets are correctly generated. Features include pre-deployment validation scripts, clean `dist` directory before building, and robust error handling during deployment.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Critical resource prioritization, deferred video loading, image lazy loading, smart resource prefetching, enhanced font loading strategies, and connection-aware performance adjustments for video streaming.
- **Stability Improvements**: Implemented memory leak fixes in monitoring middleware, disabled excessive logging, and a comprehensive stability system with request timeouts, memory usage monitoring, automatic garbage collection, and graceful shutdown handlers.
- **Security & Compliance**: SOC 2 compliance monitoring, comprehensive audit logging, production security headers, and rate limiting. Database transactions for critical operations ensure data integrity.
